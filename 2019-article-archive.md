* "When preparing to attain influence in an open organization, look for problems that need solving. That way, your contributions take the form of solutions as opposed to unwanted additions." red.ht/2lOQCo2 #TheOpenOrg

* "To create a measure of informal learning behaviors, I reviewed theories and behaviors ... documented in hundreds of journal articles and books on the subject." Measuring #adaptability isn't easy. red.ht/2XWIkY3 #TheOpenOrg
* "Succeeding in any organization—but especially an open organization—requires one to develop as a continuous learner. Evidence supports this claim." Colin Willis has done the research: red.ht/2XWIkY3 #TheOpenOrg

red.ht/2XidCIt

* New today from Colin Willis: "Become a lifelong learner and succeed at work" red.ht/2XidCIt #TheOpenOrg#adaptability
* In open organizations with cultures of adaptability, learning should be continuous—and won't always happen in a formal setting. Do we really understand how it works? Colin Willis explores: red.ht/2XidCIt #TheOpenOrg
* Recent estimates suggest that between 70% to 80% of all job-related knowledge isn't learned in training but rather informally on-the-job. Does your organization support continuous learning? red.ht/2XidCIt #TheOpenOrg
* Unlike formal training, informal learning occurs in unstructured environments, is highly dependent on the individual, and can be difficult or impossible to observe. But it's critical in #TheOpenOrg. What are you doing to support it? red.ht/2XidCIt

# A new print publication series
Bryan | 2021-09-17 15:17:14 UTC | #1

On a recent community call, I shared some thinking about a potential new series of community publications. I wanted to review that thinking here and also solicit folks' feedback on it.

## The challenge

Over the years, the Open Organization community has gotten very good at two kinds of publication, each of which has its own rhythm and produces its own "content type": the weekly article and the annual book. **Articles** are generally rather short (~1,000 words or so); **books** are generally rather long (~150 pages or more). Articles generally become **chapters**, which ultimately get collected in these **books**. It's been a nice, rewarding system that has enabled us to feature dozens of stellar authors in the past six years.

So we're producing (short) articles every week and (long) books every year, but we're not really producing anything that operates "in between" these two modes of print publication. So I was thinking of ways we might address that by introducing a new kind of print publication operating on its own cadence or in its own "mode"—something bigger-than-article but smaller-than-book.

## The benefits

I think experimenting with a new series of publication might offer a few benefits:

- **Release materials more often**: Adding a new content type to our repertoire allows us to release new things more frequently—always useful when we're trying to generate awareness and spread a message
- **Reach new audiences:** As always, we're trying to reach new interested readers and practitioners. A new content type might let us connect in new ways.
- **Attract new contributors:** A new content type would hopefully inspire new forms of contribution; people who don't "see themselves" contributing articles or chapters might see themselves doing something like this
- **Offer new kinds of collateral**: As we do more virtual conferences, downloadable resources are becoming more central to our "booth presence" in spaces like these, so a new content type might equip us to offer something new here

## The artifact

The archetype I've been mulling over is probably something like a "whitepaper" (but our community would never use a term that stodgy!)—something that's perhaps a bit more slickly designed, with varied typography and graphics, but shorter in length (I'm thinking about ~15‒20 pages as a target length, just to start). We'd typically "build" this kind of work from a series of articles strung together in a series. Initially, I'd consider publishing this in PDF and ePub, alongside Markdown source in our repositories.

## The series

In my sketches, I've been calling the new series "Open Perspectives," but I'm not really wedded to the name and welcome better ideas. I wrote this short vision statement to help frame my thinking:

> Open Perspectives is a series of short, timely, and openly licensed publications from the Open Organization project. Issues feature voices from our community of experts on open organizational culture, design, and leadership as they explore what they consider the most pertinent and pressing issues facing modern organizations—and explain how open principles can help us address those issues.

## The prototype

I've been fiddling with a template for this sort of thing, so we can eventually heavily automate production of new series installments. I'll attach a current snapshot of the look and feel, just so people can get a sense of where my head's at—and so they can offer feedback.

Ambassador @JosGroen has graciously allowed me to use his work as an experiment, and he's been helpfully offering feedback on what I think might be our first prototype. I "packaged up" Jos' recent series on an open approach to talent management and ran it through that template. I think it's a good start!

So I'm now at the stage where I'm wondering: What do others think about all this? What ideas do others have for improving it? All questions and feedback welcome.

I like the idea. The template looks great. "Open Perspectives" is a pretty good name.

Thanks, @bcotton, for the feedback. I'm glad you like the design direction!

Yeah, in my mind, _Open Perspectives_ was meant to convey the series' focus on single issues in short, sustained installments ("an open perspective on talent management," an "open perspective on running better meetings," etc.). It's just another way to differentiate our stuff in the ongoing conversation.

Would love to collect some of your writing some day, if you'd be up for it.

Of course! I could probably make a few new ones, too. Just...maybe after my book is done. :sweat_smile:

I very much like this format :) Repackaging pre-existing work is great. When my auto-tweet tweets something I wrote from 10 years ago, I'm often surprised that stuff is still relevant (sometimes it's a fail, but you know). It'd be good to resurface things and put them in new constructions.

Also, I feel like this gives contributors new ways to contribute. Looking at your template I immediately wanted to go and find you a snazzy statistic like "There are about 3% women in open source" for your in-between pages. I feel like some statistics, quotes or facts littering this format might make people gravitate towards it because they can quickly onboard others to a particular idea (e.g. Open Perspectives on Women in Open Source). We could also publish these "whitepapers" as a series of webpages (not that we have time to build a template for that, but...)

Anyway, I love the idea.

Great feedback. Thanks, @laura. As usual, you're one step ahead! @JosGroen and I are working on this (he's creating some custom graphics for the prototype), and I've already updated the working template to include multiple graphic layout options and parameters. So all this is to say: yes, for sure, more graphics!

**Update:** Attached the latest template so you can see!

"this is a very important pull quote from the article" :laughing:

Well it is! I mean, it's pretty transparent about its importance. :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:

I appreciate the discussion. One thought here, which may not be relevant to this discussion, is that I've been reading a bit about blog lengths. A lot of platforms do some data analysis to try to determine characteristics of more widely read posts (here is [an example](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq)) and I'm seeing several references to 2200-2500 words, which is a good bit longer than our typical posts. 

What I find is that in these longer posts you can get more substantive, go deeper, have a less superficial coverage, and yet it is still a consumable length that doesn't require you to set aside dedicated time for reading (i.e you could get through it between meetings or something like that). 

Just wanted to note this as one avenue to consider in this discussion

This is nice perspective to have, @samknuth. Thanks for it. Adopting slightly longer article length conventions would help us create more robust whitepapers books, too (more "raw materials" for repackaging in these other forms).

Just getting caught up... showing my support here for this idea. Will need to come back and deep dive on this later.

Great feedback and I’m working on both graphics and gathering of facts (f.e. Harvard reviews). Keep you posted and please keep giving feed forward!
